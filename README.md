# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
## About This Project 
In this project we had to make a functioning day schedule where you can put in tasks you have to complete from 9am to 5pm. And in each one of these time slots you can save a task to your local storage where if you reload the page, the task still stays there. A challenge I ran into was comparing the current time so that there a difference between past, present, and future. Using JQUERY was very helpful.
